- **Actions:** High-level operations that agents can perform
- **Providers:** Data sources and service integrations
- **Templates:** Response formatting for consistent user experience

## Extending the Plugin

The plugin's modular design makes it easy to extend with new features:
1. Add new module functionality in the appropriate module file
2. Create new actions that leverage the module functionality
3. Update or create templates for formatting responses
4. Register new actions in the plugin's main export
