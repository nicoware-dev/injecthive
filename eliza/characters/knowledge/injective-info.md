# Injective Blockchain Resources and Documentation

Injective is a high-performance, interoperable layer-one blockchain specifically designed for building premier Web3 financial applications. It positions itself as the blockchain built for finance, offering pre-built, customizable modules for creating dynamic applications. For comprehensive information, visit [Injective Documentation](https://docs.injective.network/).

Injective's architecture delivers high throughput with optimized performance and enhanced cross-chain compatibility with Ethereum, Solana, Polygon, and IBC-enabled chains. The platform provides developers with customizable modules for creating sophisticated financial applications, specifically designed for bringing global financial systems on-chain.

The Injective Wallet ecosystem supports multiple wallet types, allowing users to monitor assets and submit transactions using either Ethereum or Cosmos-native wallets. For detailed wallet information, see [Injective Wallet Documentation](https://docs.injective.network/getting-started/wallet).

Ethereum-based wallets compatible with Injective include MetaMask, Ledger, Trezor, and Torus. The transaction signing process involves converting transactions to EIP712 TypedData, signing with an Ethereum wallet, and packing into a Cosmos transaction for broadcasting to the chain.

Cosmos-based wallets supported on Injective include Cosmostation, Keplr, and Leap, providing seamless integration with the broader Cosmos ecosystem. Additionally, Injective supports its native Ninji Wallet and CEX-based wallets from Bitget and OKX for enhanced user experience.

Injective governance is community-driven, allowing staked INJ holders to participate in protocol decisions. The proposal process requires an initial deposit of 10 INJ, followed by a deposit phase requiring 100 INJ total, a four-day voting period, and implementation if approved. Learn more at [Injective Governance Documentation](https://docs.injective.network/getting-started/wallet/governance).

The governance voting system requires 33.4% of INJ holders to vote for quorum, with 50% "yes" votes needed for approval. Failed proposals may result in burned deposits, while successful ones are implemented by Injective contributors. Community discussions happen on [Injective Discord](https://discord.gg/injective) and the [Governance Forum](https://gov.injective.network/).

INJ token serves multiple functions in the Injective ecosystem, facilitating network operations, securing the network through staking in the Tendermint PoS framework, enabling governance participation, and serving as an exchange medium. For token details, visit [INJ Coin Documentation](https://docs.injective.network/getting-started/token-standards/inj-coin).

INJ implements deflationary tokenomics through an innovative burn mechanism and dynamic supply system, distinguishing it from other PoS chain tokens. These mechanisms help maintain token value and create a sustainable economic model for the network's long-term growth.

Substreams provides powerful data processing capabilities for Injective, consuming blockchain data streams and refining them for applications. Its parallel execution processes multiple data segments simultaneously, pushing information to users faster than single-worker approaches. Documentation is available at [Substreams Architecture](https://docs.substreams.dev/reference-material/architecture) and [Substreams FAQ](https://docs.substreams.dev/reference-material/faq).

StreamingFast infrastructure supports Substreams with public Firehose endpoints, subgraph integration, and free (rate-limited) access. Developers can get support through [StreamingFast Discord](https://discord.gg/streamingfast), follow updates on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/streamingfastio), or watch tutorials on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/streamingfast).

Helix is revolutionizing on-chain trading on Injective with advanced exchange infrastructure featuring an on-chain orderbook that eliminates MEV inefficiencies. It delivers high-performance transactions with instant finality and maintains a community-first approach without outside capital. Explore [Helix Documentation](https://docs.helixapp.com/) for details.

Hydro Protocol enables customizable yield and liquidity strategies on Injective, combining Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSD) with Real World Assets (RWA). Users can remain staked while utilizing tokens for trading, lending, or farming, and access unique Real Yielding Asset (RYA) products. Learn more at [Hydro Protocol Documentation](https://docs.hydroprotocol.finance/).

TruFin provides institutional-grade Web3 primitives on Injective, including liquid staking solutions. Its TruStake Injective vault offers INJ staking with the liquid token TruINJ in return. All vaults require KYC/AML verification through partners. For more information, visit [TruFin Documentation](https://trufin.gitbook.io/docs/overview/trufin) and [TruStake Injective Staker](https://trufin.gitbook.io/docs/trustake-vaults/trustake-injective-staker).

Neptune Finance offers collateral-based lending and borrowing on Injective using Rust and the Cosmos SDK. Lenders earn interest based on their share of borrower payments, while borrowers provide collateral to secure loans. The platform uses nTokens to represent lending positions and monitors account health to maintain collateral value. Documentation is available at [Neptune Finance](https://docs.nept.finance/product/overview), [Neptune Lend](https://docs.nept.finance/product/lend), and [Neptune Borrow](https://docs.nept.finance/product/borrow).

DojoSwap implements a Uniswap-inspired AMM protocol on Injective, enabling decentralized trading through liquidity pools. Users can contribute asset pairs to increase liquidity and earn LP tokens representing their stake and trading fees. The protocol uses algorithmic pricing based on asset ratios in liquidity pools. See [DojoSwap Documentation](https://docs.dojo.trading/) for more information.
